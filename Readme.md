### ‚ú® Why StreamLineDB?

In a world of complex database systems, StreamLineDB offers a refreshing approach for **read-heavy workloads**. It combines simplicity with extreme performance.

* **üöÄ Predictable, Insane Speed**
    The engine is built for modern hardware. It dynamically adapts to **multi-core CPUs**, uses the latest processor instructions (**SIMD**), and is optimized for fast **SSDs**.

* **üß† Smart & Efficient Columnar Store**
    Inspired by leaders like ClickHouse, our engine uses a **bit-packed columnar format** (`.sldb`) with specialized indexes. This means extremely fast data scans, filtering, and aggregations with minimal memory usage.

* **üì¶ Ultimate Portability**
    Your entire dataset is a **single file**. Move your application between development, staging, and production with a simple file copy. It's perfect for serverless environments, mobile apps (with offline-first capabilities), and edge computing.

* **üîó Zero-Configuration & Easy Integration**
    No servers to manage, no users to configure. Just drop the library into your project and point it to your data file.

### üó∫Ô∏è Status & Roadmap

StreamLineDB is currently in **active development**. The core concepts are being implemented, and the API is taking shape. Our current focus is on:

* **[‚úÖ] Core Engine:** A stable, high-performance, read-only bit-packed columnar store.
* **[‚úÖ] Single File Storage:** Perfecting the `.sldb` format for one file per data stream.
* **[‚è≥] In-Memory Caching:** Designing the engine to be efficiently cached in application memory.
* **[‚è≥] Native Interfaces:**
    * Java library (for Android and backend systems)
    * Native PHP extension (for high-performance web backends)
    * React Native library (for cross-platform mobile apps)
* **[ ] Advanced Query Features:** Implementing fast filtering and aggregation functions.
